# RiskLab
Lab for Processor Architecture Course. An attempt to describe a RISC type core for simulation. Yeah memory access time is assumed to be ridiculously fast in sim :P.
Description of instructions can be found in the instructions.pdf file. 
Simulation is being done in ModelSim SE-64 10.7b (Revision: 2018.06, Jun 7th 2018)
